Inspired by / based on https://github.com/JakeWharton/docker-gphotos-sync (thanks Jake!)

Example docker compose definition:

```yaml
services:
  gphotos-sync:
    build:
      context: https://github.com/spraot/gphotos-sync.git
      # I recommend using a specific commit instead though:
      # context: https://github.com/spraot/gphotos-sync.git#{FULL_GIT_HASH}
      # Optionally override the version of gphotos-cdp to use (requires rebuilding the docker image):
      # args:
      #   - GPHOTOS_CDP_VERSION=github.com/spraot/gphotos-cdp@COMMITISH
    container_name: gphotos-sync
    restart: unless-stopped
    privileged: true # chrome seems to need this to run as 1000:1000
    volumes:
      - ./profile:/tmp/gphotos-cdp
      - ./photos:/download
    environment:
      - PUID=1000  # Set to the current user's uid
      - PGID=1000  # Set to the current user's gid
      - CRON_SCHEDULE=27 * * * *
      - RESTART_SCHEDULE=26 1 * * 0
      - HEALTHCHECK_ID=d6e4a333-ce52-4129-9d3e-6722c3333333
      - LOGLEVEL=info
      - TZ=Europe/Berlin
      - ALBUMS=  # comma separated list of album IDs to sync
      - GPHOTOS_CDP_ARGS=  # additional arguments to pass to gphotos-cdp
```

Clone this repo and use ./doauth.sh to create and authenticated profile dir and ./test.sh to test that it works. Or use ./test.sh to do your initial sync.

Files deleted on Google Photos after being downloaded will not be deleted locally, but a list of such files will be saved to `.removed`.

## Downloading an album

Set ALBUMS to a comma seperated list of album IDs, where the album URL is:

```
https://photos.google.com/album/{ALBUM_ID}
```

You can provide just the album ID for normal albums, or the whole relative path in case of other types of albums (e.g. `shared/<SHARED_ALBUM_ID>`). To sync albums and the entire library, add "ALL" to the list of albums.

## Legacy mode

Setting `GPHOTOS_CDP_ARGS=-legacy` will cause the sync to run in "legacy" mode. This mode is *much* slower at scanning through your entire library, but is much faster at doing the initial synchronization (where all files need to be downloaded). Thus using -legacy for the initial synchronization can be helpful. Switching between regular and legacy mode can be done at any time.

In legacy mode, syncs always start where the last run ended, so if we want to check for new files that have a 'date taken' older than that file, you will need to delete the `.lastdone` file. RESTART_SCHEDULE automates this by deleting .lastdone file on the cron schedule givenso that the next sync will start from the beginning (skipping already downloaded files).

Note: if using -legacy mode and ALBUMS, the albums must be sorted newest first, otherwise files added after the initial sync will not be downloaded.

## Regarding language

It may be necessary to set your account language to "English (United States)" for this to work (see [#2](https://github.com/spraot/gphotos-sync/issues/2)). This is the likely cause if you see date parsing errors or similar. Help localizing [gphotos-cdp](https://github.com/spraot/gphotos-cdp/issues/2) is welcome.

## Issues caused by highlight videos

Google Photos has a feature that automatically generates highlight videos. If you save these to your account, they can cause issues with syncing. Generally they cannot be downloaded or viewed from the browser and they occasionally cause the Google Photos UI (and therefore this sync service) to freeze. I suggest deleting these from your account and restarting the sync service. If you still see issues check that your .lastdone file does not contain the URL to a highlight video.
